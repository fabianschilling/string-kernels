In this paper an approach for text document categorization is proposed using SVMs together with a unique string kernel. The inner product defined by the kernel is calculated for all ordered character sequences of a defined length, k, and are not restricted to being contiguous. An exponentially decaying factor is used to weight these subsequences based on their length in the text, penalizing those which are less contiguous. We also present an efficient dynamic programming technique for calculating the inner product, keeping the evaluation of the kernel tractable despite the exponential growth of the feature space with respect to k. The performance of the proposed approach is compared to that of using a standard word feature space kernel \cite{Joachims1998}, and a kernel utilizing contiguous character sequences defined by n-grams \cite{cavnar1995}. Evaluation of experimental results show that the proposed method performs comparatively to these alternatives [TODO: depending on what we get, revise this].
