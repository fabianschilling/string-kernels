\section{Brief Introduction to SVMs} \label{sec:background}
SVMs are supervised learning algorithms utilized for regression and classification. The core principle is to classify datapoints by learning an expression for a hyper plane which seperates the datapoints so that members of the same class are present on the same side of the hyperplane. The simplest version of this becomes a binary linnear classifier applied to datapoints in input space. In more advanced cases, It is possible to use SVMs for non-linnear classification by mapping the datapoints into a higher dimensional feature space where the expression for the seperating hyperplane is also learned by a linnear learning algorithm. The mapping into the feature space can be done with kernels, by expressing the inner product used by the SVM in learning the hyperplane's equation with the kernel function instead.  

The method presented in this paper uses the proposed kernel in section \ref{sec:method} for this mapping, in conjunction with an SVM performing [TODO: what type of learning, sub-gradient?] in order to execute the classification of text documents.
