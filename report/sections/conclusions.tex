\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

Since the performance of SSK is at best marginally better than NGK with severely higher computational complexity, we can only accept the method with reservation. We conclude that NGK with appropriate $n$-gram sizes is the favorable kernel for natural language data, especially when dealing with large text corpora. We acknowledge the potential superiority of SSK over NGK for other types of sequential data such as biological strings.
